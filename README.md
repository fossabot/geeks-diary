# Angular Electron Boilerplate

It's sucks to use electron with angular.

This boilerplate will be used to process my project.

Happy hacking today even painful!


## Structure of the project

Clone it and figure out.

Webpack configurations are located in ``tools/`` if it's a tip.

One more thing. I have not put the release process yet.

Ah, and use WebStorm for your IDE for healthy.


## Installation

```
npm i -g webpack
npm install
```


## Usage

```
npm run start   // Attach chrome debug on port 5858
npm run dev-main
npm run dev-renderer
npm run dev-renderer-aot
```
